# GEARS
Program Overview: Administered by the NC State University Global Training Initiative (GTI), GEARS is a
4 to 8 week long academic, research and cultural exchange program that enables domestic and
international students to experience campus life and academic research at universities across North
Carolina. Participants in this non-degree and non-credit program have a rich on-campus experience,
participate in a variety of cultural and social programs, explore research relevant to programs at their
home institution and present their work via a judged poster presentation exhibit. GEARS is a
competitive program whereby students submit their Transcripts and CVs and apply for particular
projects of interest mentored by university faculty. Student acceptance and placement decisions are
made after consultation between GTI staff and mentoring professors.
